# PlatformDataSecurityBabies Website

This repository contains a simple static website generated from `prd.md`.
The site includes the following pages:

- **Home**: Introduction and overview of the group.
- **About Us**: Mission and history.
- **Videos**: Embedded YouTube videos.
- **Testimonials**: Sample testimonials rendered using React from a CDN.
- **Contact**: Links to the LinkedIn page and Google signup form.

All files are located in the `public/` directory so they can be served by any

the testimonials page.
