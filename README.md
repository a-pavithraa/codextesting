# PlatformDataSecurityBabies Website

This repository contains a simple static website generated from `prd.md`.
The entire site is a single HTML page located in the `public/` directory.
Navigation links at the top of the page scroll to individual sections:

- **Home** – Introduction and overview of the group.
- **About Us** – Mission and history.
- **Videos** – Embedded YouTube videos.
- **Testimonials** – Sample testimonials rendered using React from a CDN.
- **Contact** – Links to the LinkedIn page and Google signup form.

The site uses plain HTML, CSS and a small React component for the
testimonials section, so it can be hosted on any static web host.
