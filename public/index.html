        This is a global WhatsApp group of IT professionals around the
        world. The members of the group go through very harsh criticism that
        is blunt and ruthless if they fail to meet the learning schedule. We
        do enjoy good jokes and have fun in the group. In order to be part
        of this group the above is mandatory and you should not have an ego.
        Everyone is learning in the group!

        This group is moderated by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joem75/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe M</a>
        popularly known as JoeVirus among the group members. Joe's favorite rant is
        "You are as good as your last movie. Keep your brags fresh." Keep upskilling!
